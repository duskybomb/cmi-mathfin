Election event study
Read papers on event study methodoligies , and papers on effect of elections on stock market .  
In the various methods , most common was to estimate and take abnormal returns and check whether the cummulative abnormal returns are nullified or not .
To estimate , used CAPM before event to estimate alpha and beta  and predicted  during the event . 
For hypothesis testing , wrote a t test , as the default one in r cant be used as we are using regression for estimating . 
The p values obtained mostly indicated that the effect of elections isn’t significant , it needs to be interpreted more . 
Also tried the same on post event and the p values were better compared to the event .
Thought about using other methods for estimation but the hypothesis testing becomes too complex .
