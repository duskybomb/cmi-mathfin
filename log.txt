I started by finding arbitrage between future stock prices and spot stock prices (intraday):
    Simply plotted all the future vs spot prices for all the stocks available
    Read a few research papers on arbitrage, tried to follow IIM Calcutta paper, but then realised we need future stock prices of 11 days prior to intraday data
Tried forecasting the stock prices (intraday):
    Started with changing the scale from time to volume of stocks traded. Plotted volume-series graph for it
    Using the default Random forest on stock prices v volume of stocks traded, we got a really good result. A correlation of ~0.94.
    Tried it against time, got a correlation of ~0.97
    Tried it for daily returns are got ~0.40
Went on to check how does CAPM perform on intra-day data:
    Had to do a lot of data cleaning, the data had missing values and values were oddly distributed against time
    Made 1min, 2min, 3min, 5min, 6min and 10 min intervals for the data and tried finding CAPM.
    Adjusted R-squared was ~0 for 1 min and 2 min but generally increased with increasing interval size
    Got adj R-squared of between 0.20 - 0.60 for 5min, 6min and 10min interval
    Tried a strategy based on a 5min interval, results were promising
﻿Election event study
    Read papers on event study methodoligies , and papers on effect of elections on stock market .  
    In the various methods , most common was to estimate and take abnormal returns and check whether the cummulative abnormal returns are nullified or not .
    To estimate , used CAPM before event to estimate alpha and beta  and predicted  during the event . 
    For hypothesis testing , wrote a t test , as the default one in r cant be used as we are using regression for estimating . 
    The p values obtained mostly indicated that the effect of elections isn’t significant , it needs to be interpreted more . 
    Also tried the same on post event and the p values were better compared to the event .
    Thought about using other methods for estimation but the hypothesis testing becomes too complex .
